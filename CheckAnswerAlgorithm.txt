R G B W  B G W G    RGBW   BGWG

Check exact: R with B, G with G, B with W and W with G giving:

R G B W  B G W G    R.BW   B.WG    G is found so sClue + " X" Got one
Note the .'s replacing the color matched.

Next we look for right colors wrong position.
                    R.BW   B.WG    R not found in B.WG
                    ..BW   B.WG    So we . the R
                    ..BW   B.WG    B is found so sClue + " O" Got one 
                    ...W   ..WG    Both B's dotted
                    ...W   ..WG    W is found so now SClue + " O" another
                    ....   ...G    Both W's dotted

Algorithm done because all "...." are left in copy Comp   

The sClue would be: " X O O"
